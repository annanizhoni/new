            <p>Thank you for taking the time to test my prototype app. 
            The design prompt I selected was: "Design an Art History App for an Art Gallery". 
            This initial user flow demonstrates flashcard and quiz features. 
            Users can win in-app currency called 'Pigment', 
            which can be redeemed at the shop (under construction), for prizes. 
            Please follow the prompts for the two tasks and complete the questionnaire at the end.
